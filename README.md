# SiameseNets
Implementation of SiameseNets in Keras for image classification.

Evaluated performance of Siamese Nets for 2 different applications :
- Digit Recognition (MNIST)
- Face Recognition ([ORL Face dataset](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/dtg/attarchive/facedatabase.html) )

The emphasis was on understanding the ability of Siamese Networks to create good classifiers when training data is limited and also to evaluate its performance with limited datasets against CNNs

### Results
#### Digit Recognition
